Loops
===========
for -> Elements in a list
for element in list:
  print(element)

**Bad idea to change the iterable part of the loop while looping through it. Decrement/Increment problem


while -> as long as a condition is true
while True:
  print('INFINITY!')

**Provide an exit condition!

if-Else 
Allows conditional flow from user input or specific data values

break ->
Quit a loop before it completes (both for and while loops)

continue ->
Skip current interation
