Transactions in Blockchain

A chain of blocks, all of which contain data and metadata. Each block has data about the previous block
on the previous transactions.  Sender, Recipient, Amount.

Mining a block -> Providing the computational resources to process an unprocessed transaction (list of them).
Eventually, these will be added to a new block.  Mining will result in a reward for mining a new block by 
emptying list of outstanding transactions.

Need a data structure which stores key-value pairs of Transaction data (sender, recipient, amount), order
doesn't matter.

Outgoing list needs a data structure of mutable list of values, order doesn't matter

Data structure for the blockchain which is mutable, but order DOES matter

Each identifier should only occur once, and be unique

============
Iterables
------------
-> We can loop through them

List : [ ]  : can hold multiple values, can nest lists within list, mutable, mostly one type, duplicates
are allowed, ordered.

Set:  {   }  : mutable, unordered (order not guaranteed), *cannot have duplicates*, mostly one type.

Tuple:  (   ) : Immutable, ordered list, duplicates allowed, *often mixed types. Good for hard-coded defaults
Good for grouping sorts of data, say key values, one after another.

Dictionary {'key':'val'}  :  Basically Maps. Mutable, *unordered map, no duplicate keys, often mixed types.
Unique identifier that has to be wrapped in quotations. KEYS must not be duplicated, but values can be 
duplicates. UNIQUE KEY.  Mixed data types!

Mapping data structures to parts of blockchain:
Transaction (sender, recipient, amount) -> stores key-value pairs, order not important.
Possibly a tuple, but a dictionary is better, since you always know what the key is

List of transactions -> Needs to be mutable, need duplicates, order doesn't matter.
List!

Blockchain -> Mutable, order matters.  
List!

Single Block -> Hash and Index, transactions. key-value pairs
Dictionary! Could use tuple

Participant list -> unique values, order doesn't matter. Guarantees each val occurs only once
Set!

-> To access values within a dictionary:
Use [] on list to access the value
last_block = [ ... ]
for keys in last_block:
    value = last_block[keys]
    or last_block['key_name']

++++++===
List Comprehension

(Alternative to a loop applying logic to a list)
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
double = []

For loop version
for element in list:
    double.append(element * 2)

double = [2, 4, 6, 8]

--------------
List Comprehension

double = [el * 2 for el in list]
read from right to left -> for el in list (for each element in each given list), apply logic to first el
FIRST EL mentioned is what will be outputted in new list

ADDING CONDITIONALS TO Comprehension
-> Allows us to apply conditional logic to comprehensions
Ex. 
dup_list = [el * 2 for el in list if el %2 == 0]

calc_items = [1,2]
dup_list = [el * 2 for el in list if el in calc_items]
---------------
Dict Comprehension
Take a dictionary that convers tuples to key value pairs

stats = [('age', 29), ('weight', 75), ('height', 175)]
dict_stats = {key: value for (key, value) in stats}


===============
ENUMERATE
--------

Calling enumerate([]) on a list will return a tuple with key-value pairs, with the key corresponding
to the index of the list value

    for (index, block) in enumerate(blockchain):

Creating a set -> via set() function, passing in a list
If you pass in a string, say ('Taddes'), you get '{'T', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'e', 's'}
set(['Taddes', 'Sarah', 'Pepper']) -> {'Taddes', 'Sarah', 'Pepper'}
