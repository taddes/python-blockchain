Transactions in Blockchain

A chain of blocks, all of which contain data and metadata. Each block has data about the previous block
on the previous transactions.  Sender, Recipient, Amount.

Mining a block -> Providing the computational resources to process an unprocessed transaction (list of them).
Eventually, these will be added to a new block.  Mining will result in a reward for mining a new block by 
emptying list of outstanding transactions.

Need a data structure which stores key-value pairs of Transaction data (sender, recipient, amount), order
doesn't matter.

Outgoing list needs a data structure of mutable list of values, order doesn't matter

Data structure for the blockchain which is mutable, but order DOES matter

Each identifier should only occur once, and be unique

============
Iterables
-> We can loop through them

List : [ ]  : can hold multiple values, can nest lists within list, mutable, mostly one type, duplicates
are allowed.

Set:  {   }  : mutable, unordered (order not guaranteed), cannot have duplicates, mostly one type.

Tuple:  (   ) : Immutable, ordered list, duplicates allowed, often mixed types. 

Dictionary {  'name': 'Value' }  :  Mutable, ordered map, no duplicate keys, often mixed types
