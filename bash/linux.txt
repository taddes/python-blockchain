less -> reads a file, one page at a time

locate fileName -> locates file in filesys

rmdir dirname -> removes directory 

rm * -> removes ALL in current directory
mv ../dir /newDir

cp file* newLocation/ -> acts on any file with name starting with character before *
rm file? / cp file? -> copy or delete up to the end of that text

cat reads a file in terminal 

nano opens a text editor in terminal


APPEND TEXT
cat linux.txt | grep text >> newfile.txt

REPLACE TEXT
cat linux.txt | grep text > newfile.txt

head -> prints first 10 lines
tail -> prints last 10 lines

cut -d: -f3 dir/fileName
CUT  -d -> delimiter, here a colon, -f is FIELD (created by breaking with delimiter)

| sort -name
wc /dir/name -> word count

Redirect:
Standard Streams
stdin -> Standard Input -> 0
stdout -> Standard Output -> 1

OPEN MYSQL DB ENGINE IN ROOT
mysql -u root -p < mydatabase.sql

If you get an incorrect result, use stderr to write to an err file
Ex. Incorrect url
wget pluralsight.commm 2> errorfile.txt

Working with Archives
-useful to use compression -> TAR -> Take Archives
.tar -> tar compressed
.gz -> g zip compression algo

To uncompress:

tar xzf latest.tar.gz
x-> extract z->zipped f->filename
->Creates new dir uncompressed

To compress:
tar czf newarchive.tar.gz dirname/
c->created z->zip compress f->file

To compress if you forgot to zip
gzip fileName.tar

unzip fileName -> UNZIPS!
zip filename.zip -> compresses current dir into zipfiles

Linux Kernel and fixing issues with peripherals!

lsusb -> lists usb devices
lspci 

sudo lshw -> all hardware
sudo lshw > lshw-output
(text file)
then less lshw-output

uname -r -> version of linux Kernel
ls /lib/modues -> module names for each Kernel

lsmod | grep sound -> list modules, grep mod for files with sound


NETWORK Connectivity
Troubleshoot network config
===========

ip route show -> show ip route
sudo dhclinet

DNS config
===========
Map numeric addresses to human addresses

host url.com -> returns DNS address
ping 1.1.1.1 -> sends short requests to ip addresses

SSH -> Secure Shell Protocol -> Remote machine access
===========
1. Access remote/virtual servers
2. Secure said access to servers (virtual machines, no physical access, distant servers)
->Encrypted access via session encryption

SERVER
apt install openssh-server or yum install openssh-server

CLIENT 
apt install openssh-client or yum install openssh-clients

/etc/ssh DIR CONTROLS SSH -> sshd_config ssh_config (clent to remote hosts)

ssh username@serverAddress
exit -> to exit

scp -> secure copy between machines
scp local-file.sh user@remotehost:/abs/remote/address

Linux Scripting
=========
Bash scripts end in .sh 
Start with SHEBANG LINE!
#!/bin/bash

#!/bin/bash
declare -i number1
declare -i number2
declare -i total
echo "What is your favorite number?"
  read number1
echo "What number do you hate?"
  read number2
total=$number1*$number2 
  echo "AHA! They equal " $total
exit 0

chmod +x myscript.sh -> to allow execution

man builtins will get you all the native bash options for importing functionality
